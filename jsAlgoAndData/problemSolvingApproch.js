  * Problem solving startegies:
  * 1.understand the problem:
  * a.can i restate the problem in my own words?
  * b.what are the inputs that go into the problem?
  * c.what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  * d.can the outputs be determined from the inputs? in other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem ?(you may not be able to answer this question
  * until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
  * e.how should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
